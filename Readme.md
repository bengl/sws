# SWS
      
  An instant Static Web Server (for static content).  Actually just a command line runner for connect.[static|staticProvider].  Just a quick and easy command line tool.

## Installation

    $ npm install sws

## Features

  * Everything in connect.[static|staticProvider], and not a whole lot else.
  * Stupidly simple.
  * Works with old and new versions of connect and node.
  * No logging. (Yes, that's a feature.)
  * No config file. (Yes, that's a feature.)

## Usage

    $ sws [OPTIONS] [ARGS]

Options: 
  -p, --port [NUMBER]    Listen on this port (Default is 8080)
  -s, --serve [PATH]     Serve static files from PATH (Default is .)
  -v, --version          Display the current version
  -h, --help             Display help and usage details
